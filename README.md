## The way I use it
In order not to upload just when I finish the exercises, I choose to commit more frequently in order to motivate myself on being active on Github.
Reason why, those exercises are meant to be read as ‘working in progress’: a brainstorming of ideas in the form of code and comments.
Step by step I’ll get to the solution I’ll aim to optimize it as far as I can.
